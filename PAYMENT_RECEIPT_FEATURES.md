# Payment Receipt Auto-Load & Print Receipt Features

## Implementation Summary
Date: October 10, 2025

### Features Implemented

#### 1. **Auto-Load Invoices in Payment Receipt**
The payment receipt page already had the auto-load functionality implemented. When a customer is selected, the system automatically:
- Loads all outstanding invoices for that customer (where `BalanceAmount > 0`)
- Filters invoices by the selected customer ID
- Displays them in the invoice dropdown
- Auto-fills the payment amount with the invoice balance when an invoice is selected

**Location:** `src/AccountingPro.Web/Components/Pages/PaymentReceipt.razor`
- Method: `OnCustomerChanged(ChangeEventArgs e)`
- Method: `OnInvoiceChanged(ChangeEventArgs e)`

#### 2. **Print Receipt Functionality**

##### A. New Print Receipt Page
Created a professional print receipt page at `/payments/receipt/print/{id}`

**File:** `src/AccountingPro.Web/Components/Pages/PrintPaymentReceipt.razor`

**Features:**
- Clean, professional receipt layout
- Company header with logo space
- Payment details (date, payment number, status)
- Customer information
- Payment method and reference
- Invoice number (if linked)
- Large, prominent amount display
- Notes section
- Professional footer
- Print button that triggers browser print dialog

##### B. Auto-Navigation After Payment
Both payment creation pages now automatically navigate to the print receipt page after successful payment:

1. **Payment Receipt Page** (`PaymentReceipt.razor`)
   - After creating payment, navigates to: `/payments/receipt/print/{payment.Id}`

2. **Cash Sale Page** (`CashSale.razor`)
   - After creating cash sale, navigates to: `/payments/receipt/print/{payment.Id}`

##### C. Print from Payments List
Added print button to each payment row in the payments list page.

**File:** `src/AccountingPro.Web/Components/Pages/Payments.razor`
- Added printer icon button in Actions column
- Links directly to print receipt page for each payment

##### D. Print Styles
Added print-optimized CSS to ensure clean, professional printouts.

**File:** `src/AccountingPro.Web/wwwroot/css/app.css`

**Print Styles Include:**
- Hide navigation, sidebar, and buttons when printing
- Full-width layout for printable area
- Prevent page breaks inside elements
- Remove borders and shadows for clean print
